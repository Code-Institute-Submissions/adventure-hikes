# Adventure Hikes
_“And into the forest I go, to lose my mind and find my soul.” - John Muir_

This is a website for a fictional hiking group Adventure Hikes. It primarily aims to inspire users to join the group on their outings. 

It was built as my first milestone project for Code Institute's Full Stack Software Development course, after I completed the HTML, CSS and User Centric Frontend Development modules. The topic for the project was chosen because hiking and adventure have always been close to my heart.

You can view the live website [here](https://monika-hrda.github.io/adventure-hikes/ "Adventure Hikes").

### Design

* #### Colour Scheme

* #### Typography

  Open Sans font has been used as the main font, mostly for its high legibility and "friendly" appearance. In the unlikely case it is not imported into the website correctly, Sans Serif is the fallback font. 
  
  The second font used - for page headings and navbar - is Signika. It is easily readable, which makes it a great choice for use on smartphone screens as well.

* #### Imagery

  Images used on the website were selected with the intention of creating a friendly and welcoming effect (smiling people, a group of people hiking together), as well as showcase the nature of Ireland. The hero image is meant to draw the website visitor in, images in the events section depict the area each planned hike is taking place in, and images on the gallery page are meant to further interest the visitor in joining the group on one of their hikes.

  All of these photographs were taken by Monika Hrda, the website's author. They were optimized - resized and subsequently compressed on TinyJPG website - to not waste storage or bandwidth.

### Wireframes

After identifying high level content for the website (while working with all the user stories listed above), templates were first sketched out on paper. Wireframes were then created in Balsamiq, taking three different screen sizes into consideration - smartphone, tablet, and desktop. (As the desktop and tablet version almost do not differ (except the Gallery page which will see three images used per row in the tablet version, instead of the four used in the desktop version), I opted to leave the tablet one out from the following images in this case.)
